## Overview

The Authentic Rebellion Framework is a four-act movement for escaping the Performance Prison and building authentic alternatives to extractive technology. Each act represents a stage in the journey from individual detoxification to collective infrastructure.

## The Four Acts

### Act I: Sensus - Detoxification

#### "Learning to feel again"

An anti-social social network designed to break addiction patterns created by performative social media. Anonymous, ephemeral, one-to-one emotional exchanges that restore authentic human connection.

- **Status:** ✅ LIVE
- **URL:** [https://sensus.yargnad.com](https://sensus.yargnad.com)
- **Repository:** [github.com/yargnad/Sensus](https://github.com/yargnad/Sensus)
- **Tech:** React, Node.js, MongoDB, Gemini 2.5 Flash
- **License:** GNU GPL v3.0

**Key Features:**

- Complete anonymity (no profiles, usernames, metrics)
- 24-hour cooldown prevents addiction loops
- AI-powered emotional resonance matching
- Auto-delete after 60 days (privacy by physics)
- Anti-metrics (no likes, shares, comments, followers)

### Act II: The Whetstone - Cognitive Strengthening

#### "Learning to think again"

A physical AI device that acts as a Socratic interlocutor—challenging assumptions, exposing contradictions, and helping you reason toward clarity about your beliefs and values.

- **Status:** 🔨 HARDWARE ORDERED
- **Repository:** [github.com/yargnad/The-Whetstone](https://github.com/yargnad/The-Whetstone)
- **Platform:** Radxa Rock 5B+ (24GB RAM, Rockchip RK3588)
- **Tech:** Ollama, Mistral Instruct 7B Q4_K_M (local), Persona-based RAG, Whisper STT, Piper TTS
- **License:** GNU GPL v3.0

**Why Physical?**

- **Presence over portability** - Stays in one place; you go to it intentionally
- **Privacy by architecture** - Local-first AI; conversations never leave your home
- **Tactile ritual** - Physical objects create habits (like journaling, but dialectical)
- **Sovereignty** - You own it; can't be remotely disabled or paywalled

**Philosophical Immune System:**

1. Epistemic Humility - Identify uncertainties before answering
2. Bias Detection - Check for hidden assumptions
3. Consequentialist Gate - Who benefits? Who is harmed?
4. Deontological Gate - Is this universalizable?
5. Virtue Ethics Gate - Does this cultivate excellence or vice?
6. Dialectical Mode - Steel-man opposing views before critiquing

### Act III: Kintsugi - Public Witness

#### "Making the wounds golden"

A public gallery where people share their "broken philosophies" and how they were repaired. Named after the Japanese art of mending broken pottery with gold—making the cracks part of the object's beauty.

- **Status:** 💡 CONCEPT PHASE
- **Target:** Web-based public gallery platform
- **Tech:** Mistral Instruct 7B (curation), vector search, permanent archive
- **License:** GNU GPL v3.0

**The Philosophy:**
Most of us inherit broken philosophies from trauma, indoctrination, or cultural programming. Kintsugi celebrates the **visible repair work**—the intellectual and emotional labor of rebuilding coherent meaning after disillusionment.

**How It Works:**

1. Submit your story (what you believed, what broke it, how you repaired it, what "gold" you used)
2. Stories displayed as visual artifacts with cracks and golden repairs
3. AI helps articulate transformations and surface related repair patterns
4. Optional anonymity or public claiming
5. Searchable archive by type of break, repair material, outcome stage

### Act IV: The Lyceum Network - Collective Infrastructure

#### "Building the alternative internet"

A user-owned, multi-layered, decentralized communication and compute network designed as a public commons. True digital sovereignty requires owning the physical layer.

- **Status:** 🚀 ACTIVE DEVELOPMENT
- **Repository:** [github.com/yargnad/The-Lyceum](https://github.com/yargnad/The-Lyceum)
- **Tech:** LoRa mesh, Wi-Fi HaLow, Mistral Instruct 7B (federated), Meshtastic
- **License:** GNU GPL v3.0

**Core Innovations:**

1. **AI-Enhanced Walkie-Talkie (AIWT)** - Voice over LoRa mesh via on-device STT→text→TTS
2. **NPU-Accelerated Stack** - SenseVoice-RKNN (STT) + paroli (TTS) on Rockchip hardware
3. **"Two-Brain" Power Architecture** - Sleep/wake via hardware interrupt for battery efficiency
4. **Pneuma (Federated AI)** - User-owned compute network with Proof-of-Utility tokenomics
5. **Two-Path Layer 3 Backbone** - 900 MHz LoRa PTP (resilient) + 5 GHz Wi-Fi PTP (bandwidth)
6. **Symbolon Ecosystem** - Vetted on-device apps hosted locally

**Three-Layer Architecture:**

- **Layer 1:** Access Mesh (900 MHz LoRa) - resilient, low-power, long-range for everyone
- **Layer 2:** Utility Fabric (Wi-Fi HaLow) - high-bandwidth local network, hosts Pneuma compute
- **Layer 3:** Backbone Link (Two-Path) - encrypted long-haul PTP connections

**Build Paths:**

- **Scout ($25-30):** Phone-reliant, low-cost entry point
- **Sovereign ($120-145):** Self-contained AIWT with on-device AI, first Pneuma Seed Node

## Philosophy

### The Performance Prison

Modern technology has evolved into the **Performance Prison**—a system trapping humans in cycles of performative behavior optimized for metrics rather than meaning, outsourced thinking delegated to algorithms, and extractive relationships where attention becomes commodity.

### Team Hybrid

**Human creativity is the fuel. Ethical AI is the engine.**

This framework demonstrates that AI doesn't have to optimize for engagement or extraction. It can be **affinitive**—creating resonance, facilitating connection, empowering deliberation—while remaining transparent, accountable, and open-source.

### Design Principles

1. **Ephemerality over accumulation** - Nothing hoarded or weaponized
2. **Anonymity over performance** - No profiles, metrics, or audiences
3. **Deliberation over velocity** - Slow down, think deeply
4. **Transparency over opacity** - Open-source everything
5. **Local-first over cloud-dependent** - Privacy by architecture
6. **Empowerment over automation** - AI facilitates, never replaces judgment
7. **Decentralization over corporate control** - No single point of failure

---

## Anti-Capture Mechanisms

**All projects licensed under GNU GPL v3.0** to ensure they can never be captured by corporate interests. Any derivative work must remain free and open. The code belongs to the commons, forever.

Additional protections:

- ✅ Open-source everything (code, models, hardware designs)
- ✅ Privacy by default (no tracking beyond necessity)
- ✅ Transparent reasoning (AI decisions include reasoning chains)
- ✅ Human agency (AI facilitates, never replaces)
- ✅ Decentralized governance (no single entity control)
- ✅ Forkable by design (anyone can adapt and improve)

## The Four-Act Progression

```
Act I (Sensus)
    ↓
Break addiction to performative behavior
    ↓
Act II (The Whetstone)
    ↓
Develop capacity for independent thought
    ↓
Act III (Kintsugi)
    ↓
Share transformation to inspire others
    ↓
Act IV (The Lyceum Network)
    ↓
Build permanent infrastructure for collective flourishing
```

Each act prepares you for the next. **Sensus** teaches you to feel authentically. **The Whetstone** teaches you to think independently. **Kintsugi** teaches you to witness transformation publicly. **The Lyceum Network** gives you infrastructure to build alternatives that can't be captured or shut down.
